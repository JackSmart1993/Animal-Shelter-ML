# Animal-Shelter-ML
A Project based on completing the animal shelter outcomes competition on Kaggle. A EDA followed by data cleaning, feature engineering and machine learning. Exploring different models and also the impact of adding specific features. I have added recommendations for the shelter to try and get animals a better outcome and to a loving family!
